# Model Evaluation: Finally, using the trained model, we will evaluate its 
# performance and make predictions. At the end of this script, we will have a 
# new dataset in data containing the predictions, along with a scores.json file 
# in the metrics directory that will capture evaluation metrics of our model 
# (e.g., MSE, R2).
